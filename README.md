# Crypto Price Forecasting using Large Language Models (LLMs)
This project explores the use of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for **univariate time series forecasting** of different types of cryptocurrency prices. The approach leverages structured prompting and the multimodal architecture to improve forecasting accuracy using historical price data and prompts which contains contextual and statistical details about data.
